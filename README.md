# EventSourcingTodo
Basic to-do list web app with an event-sourced domain, ASP.NET Core MVC back-end, and responsive Bootstrap UI.

## Motivation
This project is a test-bed for new (to me) development techniques and technologies. Specifically, it was created to demo CQRS, event-sourcing, ASP.NET Core MVC, client-side dev frameworks (e.g Angular, React, Aurelia), and Typescript.

## Running the App
Open the solution in Visual Studio 2017. No db is required.

## Planned Development
- Client-side framework UI (e.g Angular, React, Aurelia)
- Replace Javascript with Typescript
- CQRS backend
- EventStore
- Unit tests
